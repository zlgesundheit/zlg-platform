# FAIR Access

## What is FAIR?
Since 2016 FAIR is an important term in most scientific fields that use data. The [GO FAIR Initiative](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/) describes the topic in great detail. Considering FAIR Aspects when dealing with data means to make the data:

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**eproducible

This happens mainly by defining and publishing metadata. 

## How to realize FAIR
To make data fair it needs to be findable which means information about the existence of the data set needs to be published. With further definitions about access rights as well as describing the data with semantic models will make the data accessible and interoperable. With relevant metadata published the reproducibility of the data is rising.

See the [FAIRification process](https://www.go-fair.org/fair-principles/fairification-process/) for more information by the GO FAIR Initiative.

There are different tools available that server the purpose of the FAIR idea (i.e. [CKAN](https://ckan.org) which is used by governments wordwide to give easy access to data).

## FAIR with openEHR and ZLG
The data that is imported into an openEHR Data Repository is described in the Templates stored in a CKM but the FAIRness of this construct can be improved. In the Zukunftslabor Gesundheit the [NUM Portal](https://github.com/NUM-Forschungsdatenplattform/num-portal) - developed by the ["Netzwerk Universit√§tsmedizinen"](https://www.netzwerk-universitaetsmedizin.de) - will be tested and described for others to adopt the ZLG Tooling.

The [NUM Portal](https://github.com/NUM-Forschungsdatenplattform/num-portal) is an open-source application which gives a web-frontend to an openEHR (or FHIR) data repository. It allows the users to manage projects, templates, data sets and also a search functionality/Feasibility Explorer.

How to setup and use the NUM Portal Application together with an openEHR-Repository will be covered on the next pages.
