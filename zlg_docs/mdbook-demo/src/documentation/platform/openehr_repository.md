# OpenEHR Repository

In the OpenEHR-World the Repository is a server that acts as coordination point between data storage and users. It implements a REST API to allow for this communication.

## REST API
The OpenEHR REST API is defined in the OpenEHR-Specification (see [OpenEHR-Specification](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest)).

The REST API offers different Endpoints to manage, store, manipulate data or meta data. A comprehensive overview of the OpenEHR API can be found [here](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/ehr.html).

Please note that some Repositories offer additional API Functionality via special APIs. For example the REST API of Better and the FLAT-ECIS API by EHRBase (which was originally established by ETHERCIS).

In the future the SDT - Simplified Data Template will be defined in the Official OpenEHR Specification which builds upon the popular [FLAT Format](https://ehrbase.readthedocs.io/en/latest/02_getting_started/05_load_data/index.html#flat-format).

## Different Repository Solutions

As mentioned above there are different Implementations of OpenEHR Repositories. An up-to-date overview of these "platforms" can be found at [openehr.org](https://www.openehr.org/products_tools/platform/).
