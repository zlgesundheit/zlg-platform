# Zukunftslabor Gesundheit

In Part Project 1 of the ZLG we are working on establishing and testing technical solution for the **exchange (and use) of research data**. The involved partners shall be enabled to share data using the OpenEHR Data Framewok. The following documentation is designed to enable the reader to understand the idea of OpenEHR and to **be able to setup and work with OpenEHR Repositories, Data and Tools**.

## Part Projects of the Zukunftslabor

## About Part Project 1
The work on an interoperable research platform is leading towards the core goals of the Future Lab Health and the organizationally superordinate Center for Digital Innovations Lower Saxony (ZDIN for short). The focus of the ZDIN and thus of the Future Labs is on networking players, ideas, and competencies from research and practice. The location of Lower Saxony is to be strengthened through networking and digitization of Lower Saxony's top players from science and industry. The [partners](../misc/partners.md) involved in the Future Labs implement or jointly initiate forward-looking research projects on an interdisciplinary and cross-location basis.  

Similar projects, such as the HiGHmed project, have already demonstrated in their project duration the complexity and financial expenditure for both personnel and hardware and software in establishing research data infrastructures. In the HiGHmed project, Medical Data Integration Centers are being established at university hospitals, where medical data are interoperably modeled and stored, and then made available for inter-institutional exchange under certain conditions.  

Within the framework of the ZL-G, work is taking place that supports both the strategic goals of the ZL-G and the ZDIN, as well as complementing similar projects such as HiGHmed, and thus, oriented to the current state of scientific knowledge, fits into the scientific landscape in a meaningful way. 
The strategic goals of the ZDIN and the Future Laboratory are implemented at the operational level in research projects in cross-institutional collaboration by the ZL-G partners. In the ZL-G, this work takes place in the three subprojects, which are thematically concerned with the topics of data exchange and analysis (subproject 1), sensor technology (subproject 2) and education, training and further education (subproject 3). The research of an interoperable research platform, which is the focus of this document, is set up as a work package in subproject 1. Corresponding work packages with content on data analysis and data management or governance are also located in subproject 1.  

At the working level, the initial phase of the project (years 1 and 2) is aimed at obtaining scientific knowledge in the areas of interoperable data exchange and analysis of interoperably modeled data. A research platform with comprehensive functionalities is composed of different modules or components, which include or require a variety of different processes for implementation, maintenance, operation and use. The research of such platforms can therefore be realized by building, testing and documenting individual processes around the use of an interoperable research data platform. In concrete terms, this is done by developing processes on the basis of a use case, which includes governance processes for the ZL-G, testing the technical implementation in the context of the selected use case, and translating the experience gained in the form of scientific publications, in the form of teaching content or demonstrators for ZL-G teaching, and other public presentations of the work done.  

In the following years (years 3 - 5), the validation or evaluation with subsequent further development is scheduled.
