## About CKAN
CKAN is the worldâ€™s leading open-source data portal platform. CKAN makes it easy to publish, share and work with data. It's a data management system that provides a powerful platform for cataloging, storing and accessing datasets with a rich front-end, full API (for both data and catalog), visualization tools and more.

## ZLG-Context
In the Zukunftslabor Gesundheit Environment we utilize CKAN as a data portal to manage data sets that are stored in the ZLG-Platform.  

While ehrbase and etl-pipelines are run locally to get data into the openEHR-World / into the openEHR-Format  
the CKAN-Instance might be run centralized in the longterm to give an overview over the different datasets that exist at the partner sites in the ZLG Verbundprojekt!

## Startup
I used the keitaroinc docker-compose-setup since buiding the official things did not work due to outdated schema.xml for solr and deprecated python 2 support..
Change CKAN_URL-env in .ckan-env-File to match the servers ip!
```docker-compose up -d```
