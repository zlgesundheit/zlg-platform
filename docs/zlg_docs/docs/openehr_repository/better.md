# Better OpenEHR-Repository

The Better openEHR-Repository/EhrScape is a commercial software solution made by Better. Better was one of the earliest commercial vendors in the openEHR-Field and also did great work towards the further development of the Standard. 

Since Better has an additional API, besides the Standard OpenEHR API as defined in the OpenEHR-Specification, some things that work with better might not work with other Repositories.

Also note the comprehensive FLAT-Format support by Better. The FLAT-Format allows to deal with Compositions and Templates (Web Templates) in an easily human-readable way.

This also affects for example the processing of AQL Queries. The Better Platform allows for more Quality of Life when interpreting Query Strings which may lead to problems when using Queries from Better Users on other Repositories.

For more information about Better and the Better OpenEHR-Repository see [Better Website](https://better.care).

Also see the [EHRScape Platform](https://www.ehrscape.com) by Better which is supposed to be a (open) community-edition of the Better Platform in the future.
