# REST Calls and Postman

The communication with an openEHR Repository happens via REST Calls using the standardized [openEHR API](https://specifications.openehr.org/releases/ITS-REST/latest/ehr.html).

Postman is one representative of available API-Platform Tools. It allows for the management of numerous API-Calls, Test-Procedures and easy use of different API-Environments. For more information about Postman see [Postman-Website](https://www.postman.com).

In the context of openEHR we can use Postman or similar tools to communicate with the API of the openEHR-Repository. This comes in handy to upload Templates, upload small sets of compositions, manipulate existing entries, query existing resources or test and develop software meant to work with an openEHR-Repository.

On the following pages we cover how to:
- [Upload one Template](./upload_template.md)
- [Create one EHR](./create_ehr.md)
- [Upload one Composition](./upload_compositions.md)

The other tools presented in this section are all supporting you in communicating with the platform.
