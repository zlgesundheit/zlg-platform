# HAMSTRETLBuilder

The HAMSTR ETL Builder is a tool to import data into an OpenEHR-Repository. While being optimized to work with the Better Repository in an earlier version the tool by now also supports importing into other repositories (e.g. EHRBase).


## What the HAMSTR Loader does
The tool supports creating compositions via a Graphical User Interface.

Different data sources can be used either via an SQL Query directly from an existing data store or from an CSV-File.

For detailled instructions see the Hamstr Gitlab Project.
